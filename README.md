This is a game made in unity where you have to reach the train before it is full. The game is similar to subway subway surfer. You run down a street while there are obstacles in the street. You gain speed over time with no cap. The different obstacles slow you at different speeds and the best strategy is to hit the obstacles the only slow you by a bit so you don’t go too fast and hit something that will make you fully stop. Your character can go side to side, jump, and slide to dodge obstacles. You also have to collect enough coins to pay for the train. There are also energy drinks that give you extra speed.

Backstory:
This game was made in 4 days during the DePaul Summer Game Development Camp. Our team was made up of 3 programmers and 2 artists. I ended up doing like 80% of the programming because my other 2 teammates were new to unity and programming. To quote our instructor "Your game is like an actual game, but having you [on the team] was basically cheating.”

The best working build is "real final build under the build folder"
